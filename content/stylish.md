# Make it *stylish*
You now know a few elements. Let's learn how to change them more pleasant to look at in a few different ways.
## The *Style* Attribute
The style of an HTML element can be set with the **style attribute**:
```XML
<tagname style="property: value;">
```
The **property** is a CSS property, associated with its CSS **value**. We'll talk about **CSS** later on.  
Some of the most used **properties** are:
 - **background-color** - used to change an element's background color
 - **color** - changes an element's text color
 - **font-family** - used to change the font
 - **font-size** - changes the size of the font
 - **text-align** - changes the text alignment (center, right, left,...)

```XML
<body style="background-color: Tomato; color: #fff; text-align: center;">

<h1 style="background-color: DodgerBlue;">
<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 160%;">
```
Try changing those properties on your Web Page, see if that makes any difference...
> This is were "Inspect Element" will be particularly useful, as you can change properties and values in a fast and easy way. **Try it!**
