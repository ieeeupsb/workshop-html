## What now?
1. Try to master **block** and **inline** elements. While they might seem simple at first, they get rather complicated once you start nesting them.
2. Try to master **paddings** and **margins** - they are really useful, always.
3. Make your Web Page **responsive** - perhaps the most important, make your page **look good on every device**, whether it is on PC, Mobile, Tablet, ...
4. Learn how to make **tables**
5. Use **bootstrap**, **font awesome**, and other tools to help you make better pages
6. Learn **Javascript** to make your page more dynamic
7. ...

> Always keep trying to improve, search for **html themes** online, take a look at the HTML Source of the ones you like the most, trying to understand how those pages were created. You'll see that **you'll always learn something new** just by inspectig the elements...

## Where to find information
