# Getting Started

## What is HTML?
*What exactly is HTML? And why should I care?*  
**HTML**, Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating **Web Pages** and **Web Applications**. It is usually not considered a programming language but rather (as the name indicates) a markup language, i.e. it describes the structure of a Web Page using **markup**.

*And what is Markup?*  
A **markup language** is a way of annotating a document - this way, the HTML code tells the software (browser) to preform certain actions (make the text smaller, change its color, add a link, etc.) but those instructions are omitted from what the user sees.  
In fact, if you want to see the HTML behind a page like [**FEUP**](http://fe.up.pt)'s, open the page, right-click a blank space, and select `View Source` (on most browsers, you could also use `Ctrl + U`). You will see a lot of structured text - this is the text that is interpreted by the browser to turn into the Web Page that you usually see.

## What are the required tools?
### Text editor
Any text editor will be enough to get started with HTML (*yes, even the simple `notepad`*). But, for the sake of your sanity, we recommend you use a text editor with more extras - like code highlighting or auto-complete.

A few examples are: [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Atom](http://atom.io/),...  

**During the workshop,** we'll be using **Notepad++** (for Windows) or **Kate** (for Ubuntu), as they are already installed in every computer in FEUP. 

### Browser
Once again, every browser is capable of interpreting HTML. That's their job after all.  
We recommend you use **Chrome** or **Firefox**, as they come equipped with tools that will be useful later on.

## Using FEUP's Web Pages
We'll be using the Web Hosting that FEUP has for every member of the community - you can check out yours at [http://fe.up.pt/~login](http://fe.up.pt/~login) (where `login` should be replaced with your username, usually `up201xxxxxx`).  
If you have never edited your page, you should see a **Welcome** page, saying that the owner hasn't created any content. We'll show you how to change that...
